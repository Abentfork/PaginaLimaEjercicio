        <h1>Who We Are?</h1>
        <p>We are Franz Ferdinand, a Scottish indie rock band formed in Glasgow in 2002. Known for our infectious hooks, sharp lyrics, and electrifying energy, we've been pushing the boundaries of alternative rock for over two decades.<br><br>

            Our breakthrough hit "Take Me Out" catapulted us into global recognition, earning us accolades and a devoted fan base. Since then, we've released a string of acclaimed albums, including our self-titled debut, You Could Have It So Much Better, and Always Ascending.<br><br>
            
            Blending danceable grooves with art-rock aesthetics, we aim to create music that gets people moving while sparking connection and emotion. Whether it's a sweaty club gig or a massive festival stage, we live for the live music experience and the shared energy with our fans.<br><br>
            
            Welcome to our world â€“ where the rhythm is irresistible, and every song tells a story.
